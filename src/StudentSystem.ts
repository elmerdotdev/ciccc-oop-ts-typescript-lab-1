// 🏫 Create a Student Management System where students can be added, marked as passed/failed, and checked for status.
// 1. Create a union literal type called StudentStatus that can be "active", "graduated", or "dropped".
// 2. Create a type alias called Student which contains: studentId (number), name (string), age (number), subjects (string[]), status (StudentStatus).
// 3. Create a function called addStudent which will add a student to the students array. The function needs to return a Student object.
// 4. Create a function called updateStatus which updates a student's status. The return needs to be a string.
// 5. Create a function called addSubject which adds a subject to a student’s subjects array. The return needs to be a string.
// 6. Create a function called getStudent which returns a student’s information based on studentId.

type StudentStatus = "active" | "graduated" | "dropped";

type Student = {

}

let students: Student[] = [];

function addStudent(studentId, name, age, subjects, status) {

}

function updateStatus(studentId, status) {

}

function addSubject(studentId, subject) {

}

function getStudent(studentId) {

}

// Test cases (Create more if needed)
console.log(addStudent(1, "Alice", 20, ["Math", "Science"], "active")) // { studentId: 1, name: "Alice", age: 20, subjects: ["Math", "Science"], status: "active" }
console.log(updateStatus(1, "graduated")) // "Alice has graduated"
console.log(addSubject(1, "History")) // "History added to Alice's subjects"
console.log(getStudent(1)) // { studentId: 1, name: "Alice", age: 20, subjects: ["Math", "Science", "History"], status: "graduated" }
